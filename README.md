# Classic Arcade Game
In this game you have a Player and bugs. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
## Game Functionality
* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won

# Installation
Download [URL](https://github.com/chloeqingyidong/arcadegame.git) from the Github respository, and run the code with your browswer 
or your favourite IDE (ntegrated development environment).

# Contributing
You are encouraged to help me add complexity to the game!!
## Additional Functionality (Optional)
* Player selection: allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game. You can use the different character images provided in the images folder (weâ€™ll get to that below)
* Score: you can implement a score for the game. For example, the score can increase each time the player reaches the water, and it can be reset to 0 when collision occurs (or it can be reduced)
* Collectibles: you can add gems to the game, allowing the player to collect them to make the game more interesting
* Anything else you like!
